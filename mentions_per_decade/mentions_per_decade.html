    <h3>Colors with dramatic changes in usages</h3>
    <p>
        For each color, we computed a linear regression on the number of times in was mentioned over the decades.<br>
        To find the most dramatically increasing/decreasing colors, we took colors within the 90% percentile slope.<br>
        Out of the 410 colors analyzed, <b>320</b> increased in usage over time, while <b>90</b> decreased in usage over time.<br>
